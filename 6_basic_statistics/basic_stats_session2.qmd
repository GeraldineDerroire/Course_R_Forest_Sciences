## Uses of regressions

* Study the relationship between several variables (without assuming causality)

* Study the effect of numerical or categorical variables on another variables 

* Use these relationships to predict the values of the modelled variable for new observations.


## Structure of a linear regression

A linear regression is a mathematical model of the relationship between:

* A **response variable**, also called *dependent variable*

* One or several **explanatory variables**, also called *predictors* or *independent variables*



# Simple linear regression

## Nouragues tree data {.scrollable}

[We will work on a modified version of Nouragues tree data from the package BIOMASS (available     [here](https://geraldinederroire.github.io/Course_R_Forest_Sciences/6_basic_statistics/data/data_statistics_2.RData){preview-link="false"}).]{style="font-size: 30px"}

## Relationship between D and H

[We want to model the relationship between *D* (the explanatory variable) and *H* (the response variable).]{style="font-size: 30px"}

## Fitting a simple linear regression

[We use the function [lm]{style="color:indianred;"} to fit a linear regression:]{style="font-size: 30px"}

```{r}
mod_dh_1 <- lm(H ~ D, # formula
               data = dt_nou)
```

Syntax of the formula:

* response variable ~ explanatory variable(s)

* the intercept is implicit so *H ~ D* is equivalent to *H ~ 1 + D*

[[If we don't want an intercept, we have to write *H ~ 0 + D*. The regression will go through the origin (0,0).]{style="font-size: 30px"}]{.fragment}

* [*Coefficients* give the estimates of **intercept** ($\alpha$) and the **slope** ($\beta$).]{style="font-size: 30px"}

  * *intercept*: the value of H for D=0 is 13.26

  * [A t-test is performed to see if there are significant (significantly different from 0).]{style="font-size: 30px"}

:::
::::::

::: notes
Null model : a model without explanatory variable
F-test for only one single explanatory variable is the same as the test for the explanatory variable
:::

## Coefficient of determination 

**R^2^** is the coefficient of determination: it represents the **proportion of variance of the response variable explained by the model**. The closer *R^2^* is to 1, the greater the explanatory power of the model.
*R^2^* therefore reflects the **goodness of fit** of the model.

[Adjusted *R^2^* penalise *R^2^* by the number of explanatory variables (not relevant when there is just one explanatory variable).]{.fragment}

## *R^2^* and *p-value*

* The **p-value** indicates the **significance of the effect** of the explanatory variable: this effect can be small yet highly significant => a small p-value is particularly important for hypothesis testing.


* The **R^2^** indicates the **goodness of fit** (how well the model fits the observed data) => a high *R^2^* is particularly important for prediction.


## Confidence interval

The **confidence interval** is the interval of confidence of the mean predicted value of y (so of $\mu$).

[[To calculate it, we can use the function [ggpredict]{style="color:indianred;"} from the package [ggeffects]{style="color:indianred;"}. The default give the confidence interval:]{style="font-size: 30px"}]{.fragment}

::: fragment
```{r}
# Get the prediction (default arguments gives the confidence interval)
preds_conf <- ggpredict(mod_dh_1, # model used for the prediction
                        terms = "D") # explanatory variable
slice_head(as.data.frame(preds_conf), n=3) # visualise the results
```
:::

::: notes
here the object is a dataframe and an object of class ggeffects
so to visualise it better, look at it as a dataframe
:::


## Confidence interval

[We can then plot the prediction mean and confidence interval:]{style="font-size: 30px"}

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| out-width: 60%
gpred_1 <- ggplot(preds_conf, aes(x = x, y = predicted)) +
  geom_line(colour = "blue", linewidth = 1) + # predicted mean
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high), # confidence interval
              fill = "blue", alpha = 0.2) + 
  geom_point(data = dt_nou, aes(x = D, y = H), alpha = 0.6) + # data
  labs(x = "D", y = "H", title = "Predicted H vs D") +
  theme_minimal()
gpred_1
```

## Prediction interval {.scrollable}

The **prediction interval** includes the uncertainty of the predicted mean (like the confidence interval) and the variability of individual prediction by taking into account the residual variance $\sigma^2$.
[It is therefore wider than the confidence interval and contains most of the observations.]{.fragment}

[[To calculate it, we can use the function [ggpredict]{style="color:indianred;"}, with the argument *interval = "prediction"*:]{style="font-size: 30px"}]{.fragment}

::: fragment
```{r}
# Get the prediction with prediction interval
preds_pred <- ggpredict(mod_dh_1, # model used for the prediction
                        terms = "D", # explanatory variable
                        interval = "prediction")
slice_head(as.data.frame(preds_pred), n=3) # visualise the results
```
:::


## Prediction interval

[We can then add the prediction interval to the plot:]{style="font-size: 30px"}

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| out-width: 70%
gpred_1 <- gpred_1 +
  geom_ribbon(data = preds_pred, aes(ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high), 
              fill = "lightblue", alpha = 0.4) +
  theme_bw()
gpred_1
```



## Model validation

We need to check the model assumptions:

* normality of the residuals

* independence of the residuals

* constant variance of the residuals (homoscedasticity)

* linearity of the relationship between response and explanatory variables

## Homoscedasticity and independence of the residuals

## Which model should we choose?

Here we would prefer the log-log model because:

* it is better regarding the model assumptions and reduced the leverage effect

* it has a slightly better R^2^

* it make more sense ecologically

[[⚠️ We will talk later about the AIC to compare models. We **cannot** use it here because the response variables are different (D *vs* log(D)).]{style="font-size: 30px"}]{.fragment}

::: notes
it makes more sense ecologically because of the shape of the relationship => for big trees, the increase in height for unit DBH is less
:::


## Presenting the results

[We have seen how to plot the results, but here we need to back-transform them to their original (non-logged) scale. By default, the function [ggpredict]{style="color:indianred;"} back-transform the predictions:]{style="font-size: 30px"}

```{r}
# Get predictions back on original scale
preds_conf <- ggpredict(mod_dh_2, terms = "D") # default gives the confidence interval

# plot the results
g_preds_2 <- ggplot(preds_conf, aes(x = x, y = predicted)) +
  geom_line(color = "blue", linewidth = 1) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high), fill = "blue", alpha = 0.2) +
  geom_point(data = dt_nou, aes(x = D, y = H), alpha = 0.6) +
  labs(x = "D", y = "H", title = "Predicted H vs D (log-log model, back-transformed)") +
  theme_minimal()

## Presenting the results

[To add the prediction interval, we set the argument *interval* to "prediction":]{style="font-size: 30px"}

```{r}
# Get predictions back on original scale, with prediction interval
preds_pred <- ggpredict(mod_dh_2, terms = "D", interval = "prediction")  

# plot the results
g_preds_2 <- g_preds_2 +
  geom_ribbon(data = preds_pred,
              aes(ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high), 
              fill = "lightblue", alpha = 0.4)
```

## Presenting the results

#| warning: false

## Data transformation

Why transform the data?

* linearise a non-linear relationship (*eg*: quadratic relationship $y = \alpha + \beta_1 \times x + \beta_2 \times x^2$, square root or log-transformation...)

* improve normality and homoscedasticity of the residuals (*eg*: square root of log-transformation...)

* reduce the influence of outliers (*eg*: log-transformation...)


::: notes
show on the blackboard the shape of a quadratic and square root (as log) 

always explore the shape of the relationsing with simulated data, to understand what the transfo does
:::


## What if the predictor is categorical? 

[We now want to model D as a function of the family:]{style="font-size: 30px"} 

$$D \sim \mathcal N(\alpha_{fam},  \sigma^2)$$

[[Let's do it on the 3 most abundant families:]{style="font-size: 30px"}]{.fragment}

::: fragment
```{r}
fam3 <- dt_nou %>% count(family) %>% # get the 3 most abundant families

# Multiple linear regression 

## Equation 

A multiple linear regression is a regression with several explanatory variables:

$$y \sim \mathcal N(\alpha + \beta_1 \times x_1 + \beta_2 \times x_2 + ... + \beta_n \times x_n,  \sigma^2)$$
which we can also write:


$$y \sim \mathcal N(\alpha + \sum_{i=1}^n\beta_n \times x_n ,  \sigma^2)$$
[💡 Explanatory variables can be numerical or categorical.]{.fragment}

## Fitting a multiple linear regression

Let's predict the best record time in bicycle races in Scotland (*time*), with the explanatory variables distance (*distance*) and altitude gained (*climb*), using the dataset *hills* from the MASS package:

```

:::
:::::

::: notes
we detach the package to avoid select being masked

note that dist is in miles and varies between 2 and 28

climb is in meters and varies between 300 and 7500 feets.

[We fit a multiple linear regression in the same way than a simple one, adding the explanatory variables with a [+]{style="color:indianred;"}:]{style="font-size: 30px"}

```{r}
mod_hills <- lm(time ~ dist + climb, hills)

## Standardising explanatory variables

[To compare the effects of the explanatory variables, we can (but we don't necessarly need) standardise them using the function [scale]{style="color:indianred;"}:]{style="font-size: 30px"}

```{r}
hills <- hills %>% 
  mutate(dist_sd = as.numeric(scale(dist)), # scale return a matrix so need to transform

## Model comparison

[To compare several models, we can use the AIC (Akaike information criterium).]{style="font-size: 30px"}

[The AIC take into account the likelihood of the model while penalising a more complex model (*i.e.* a model with more parameters) to avoid over-fitting.]{style="font-size: 30px"}

[[To compare models using the AIC, they need to:]{style="font-size: 30px"}]{.fragment}

* [have the same response variable (not possible to compare a model with a transformation of the response variable with a model without transformation)]{style="font-size: 30px"}

* [be fitted on the same data (so be careful with NAs)]{style="font-size: 30px"}

[[**The model with the lowest AIC is the best model** (we usually consider a model difference of at least 2).]{style="font-size: 30px"}]{.fragment}


::: notes
explain overfitting: when a model fit the data too closely, capturing random noise and fluctuation in addition to the true underlying pattern

the value of AIC has no meaning, it needs to be used to compare models
:::


## Model comparison {.smaller}

[Let's compare our models with and without interactions, and models with only one explanatory variable.

list_mod <- list(hills_dist = mod_hills_dist, 
                 hills_climb = mod_hills_climb, 
                 hills2 = mod_hills2,

## What if the observations are not independent? 

An linear regression assumes that all observations are **independent**.

When observations are grouped, they are not independent (*e.g.* several observations on a same site, on a same individual, in a same year...).

* We can include the group as a categorical explanatory variable. This evaluate the effect of each group.

* When the number of groups is too high and we are not interested in the effect of each group, we can use a **linear mixed model**.

## Linear mixed model {.smaller}

[Linear mixed models have a hierarchical structure.]{style="font-size: 30px"}

::: fragment

[One or more of their coefficients (the intercept or the response to explanatory variable) varies between groups *j*:]{style="font-size: 30px"}

$$y_k \sim \mathcal N(\alpha_{j[k]} + \beta_1 \times x_1 + \beta_2 \times x_2 + ... ,  \sigma^2)$$
:::

::: fragment

[and this variation is modelled by a distribution:]{style="font-size: 30px"}

$$\alpha_j \sim \mathcal N(\mu_{\alpha}, \sigma^2_{\alpha})$$

[*NB: here we represent the effect of the group only on the intercept, but we can include this effect on the other coefficients as well.*]{style="font-size: 22px"}

## What if the data are not normally distributed?

Some data are by nature not normally distributed, so we cannot model them with a normal distribution.

* count data (*e.g.*: number of individuals of a species in a plot, number of birds heard in a given time) can be modelled with a **Poisson** distribution

* success/failure data (*e.g*: presence/absence of a species in a plot, proportion of tree browsed in a plot) can be modelled with a **binomial** distribution

[[To know more about these distributions: see the Wikipedia pages, and the [distribution zoo](https://ben18785.shinyapps.io/distribution-zoo/){preview-link="false"}.]{style="font-size: 25px"}]{.fragment}


## Generalised linear models

*Generalised linear models* (**GLM**) are an extension of linear models allowing different distributions of the response variable.

[[They have 3 component:]{style="font-size: 30px"}]{.fragment}

* [a **linear predictor**: a linear combination of explanatory variables]{style="font-size: 30px"}

* [a **distribution** of individual responses around their mean]{style="font-size: 30px"}

* [a **link function** between the predictor (defined on $\mathbb{R}$) and the mean response (not necessarily defined on $\mathbb{R}$)]{style="font-size: 30px"}

[[In the linear model seen before, the distribution is *Normal* and the link function the *identity*.]{style="font-size: 25px"}]{.fragment}


## Logistic regression

[The logistic regression is a **GLM** with a **binomial distribution** and a **logit link function**. It models a probability of success.]{style="font-size: 30px"}

* [The binomial distribution $\mathcal{B}(n, p)$ represents the number of successes when performing ***n*** independent experiment having a constant probability of success ***p***. ]{style="font-size: 30px"}[[It is a discrete distribution taking only **positive integer values**.]{style="font-size: 30px"}]{.fragment}

* [The logit link function links the modelled probability of success (which is between 0 and 1) to the linear predictor.]{style="font-size: 30px"}

[[The Bernoulli distribution is a special case of a binomial when n=1.]{style="font-size: 25px"}]{.fragment}

::: notes
logit(p) = alpha + beta_1*x_1 +... beta_n*x_n

avec logit(p) = log (p/ (1-p))

## Poisson

[The Poisson regression is a **GLM** with a **Poisson distribution** and a **logarithm link function**. It models the number of observations of an event in a defined sampling unit.]{style="font-size: 30px"}

* [The Poisson distribution $\mathcal{P}(\lambda)$ represents the mean number of observations **$\lambda$** in a sampling unit.]{style="font-size: 30px"}

* [The logarithm link function links **$\lambda$** (which is positive) to the linear predictor.]{style="font-size: 30px"}
