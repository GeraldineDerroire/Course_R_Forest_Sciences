## Some definitions - Reproducibility

> "Reproducibility is a key tenet of the scientific process that dictates the <span style="color:slateblue;">reliability</span> and <span style="color:slateblue;">generality</span> of results and methods." 
> Powers & Hampton ([2019](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/eap.1822)) *Ecological Applications*

Full reproducibility is almost impossible in natural system so computational repro

## Some definitions - Computational reproducibility

> "Computational reproducibility often refers to the ability to
produce equivalent analytical outcomes from the <span style="color:slateblue;">same data set</span> using the <span style="color:slateblue;">same code</span> and <span style="color:slateblue;">software</span> as the original study."

# Why making science reproducible?

# For our future self!

![](not_repro.png)

# More reliable and safe

* Analyses can be re-run if needed.
* It allows detecting and correcting errors.

# Transparency

* Easier for others (and the future you...) to understand your work.

* Requirement of journals and fundings

# Rapid scientific advancement

* You and other can build on previous analyses.

* You can easily update your analyses when more data become available.

# Increase your visibility and credibility

>“An article about computational results is advertising, not scholarship. The actual scholarship* is the full software environment, code and data, that produced the result.”
> Claerbout and Karrenbach 1992.


# How to implement reproducible science?

<!-- TO DO -->

## Main principles

- document (metadata, scripted analyses...)

Metadata, sometimes referred to as data about data or a data dictionary Jenkins et al 2023

- start from the beginning of the project

- organise the workflow

## Main steps

<!-- This is copied pasted from Wilson et al 2017-->

• Data management: saving both raw and intermediate forms, documenting all steps, creating
tidy data amenable to analysis.
• Software: writing, organizing, and sharing scripts and programs used in an analysis.
• Collaboration: making it easy for existing and new collaborators to understand and contrib-
ute to a project.
• Project organization: organizing the digital artifacts ofa project to ease discovery and
understanding.
• Tracking changes: recording how various components ofyour project change over time.
• Manuscripts: writing manuscripts in a way that leaves an audit trail and minimizes manual
merging ofconflicts.
