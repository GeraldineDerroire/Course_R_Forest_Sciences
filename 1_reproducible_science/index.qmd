# What is reproducible science?

![](lets_talk.png)

## This is not reproducible science...

![](many_version.png)

::: {.notes}
Why?
:::

## This is not reproducible science either...

![](not_repro.png)

::: {.notes}
Why?
:::


## Still not reproducible science...

> "We collected data following standard protocols and analysed them using the StatForDummies software."

::: {.notes}
Why?
:::

## This is reproducible science!

![](repro_science.png)

::: {.notes}
A clear workflow from the data collection to communication of the results (paper, com...) 
in which every step is well documented
:::


## Some definitions - Reproducibility

> "Reproducibility is a key tenet of the scientific process that dictates the <span style="color:slateblue;">reliability</span> and <span style="color:slateblue;">generality</span> of results and methods." 
> Powers & Hampton ([2019](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/eap.1822){preview-link="false"}) *Ecological Applications*

::: {.notes}
Reproducibilyu => be able to reproduce a study and come to the same results
Full reproducibility is almost impossible in natural system so computational repro 
=> computational repro
:::

## Some definitions - Computational reproducibility

> "Computational reproducibility often refers to the ability to
produce equivalent analytical outcomes from the <span style="color:slateblue;">same data set</span> using the <span style="color:slateblue;">same code</span> and <span style="color:slateblue;">software</span> as the original study."
> Powers & Hampton ([2019](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/eap.1822){preview-link="false"}) *Ecological Applications*

::: {.notes}
So to acheive that, we need to document clearly all the steps, and make the different products available

# Why make science reproducible?

# For our future self!

![](not_repro.png)

# More reliable and safe

* Analyses can be re-run if needed.
* It allows detecting and correcting errors.

# Transparency

* Easier for others (and the future you...) to understand your work.

* Requirement of journals and fundings

# Rapid scientific advancement

* You and other can build on previous analyses.

* You can easily update your analyses when more data become available.

# Increase your visibility and credibility

>“An article about computational results is advertising, not scholarship. The actual scholarship* is the full software environment, code and data, that produced the result.”
> Claerbout and Karrenbach 1992.


# How to implement reproducible science?

## Main principles

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.incremental}
- Organise your work in a clear and standardised way
- Document all the steps and products (metadata, scripted analyses, readme...)
- Start from the beginning of the project

::: {.notes}
Metadata, sometimes referred to as data about data or a data dictionary Jenkins et al 2023
:::

## Main steps

Wilson *et al* ([2017](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005510){preview-link="false"}) *PLoS Computational Biology*

![](Wilson_steps.png)

::: {.notes}
Great overview of all the steps
:::


## Main steps - Data management

::: {.incremental}
- Save both raw and corrected data
- Document all steps of data preparation
- Create analysis-friendly data with metadata
:::

## Main steps - Software

::: {.incremental}
- Write scripts for all the analyses
- Test these scripts!
- Document the scripts (explain what they do)
- Share the scripts 
:::

::: {.notes}
"script" to mean "something that is executed directly as is" and "program"
to mean "something that is explicitly compiled before being used"
:::

## Main steps - Collaboration

Make it easy for other to contribute to your project by:

::: {.incremental}
- Explaining the organisation of the project
- Sharing tasks and making to do list
- Deciding on best way to communicate
:::

## Main steps - Project organisation

::: {.incremental}
- Organise the workflow and break it into steps
- Organise files (script, data, docs) into standardised directories
- Adopt a coherent and explicit naming system for files and objects
:::

## Main steps - Tracking changes

::: {.incremental}
- Backup all changes made
- Keep track of versions 
:::

::: {.notes}
keep track of version: know what has been changed between two versions
:::

## Main steps - Writing

Integrate writing into the workflow for easy control of version and update

![](quarto-process.png)

::: {.notes}
Just as for the code, we need to know how the manuscript (and its figures) was produced
what changes were made, etc...
:::

## Main tools

![](tools_all.png)

::: {.notes}
many tools exist, there are the one we are going to use
:::

## Main tools

![](tools_R.png)


## Main tools

![](tools_tidyverse.png)

::: {.notes}
collection of tools (packages) that will help us coding in R
:::

## Main tools

![](tools_git.png)

::: {.notes}
git for version control
:::

## Main tools

![](tools_github.png)

::: {.notes}
github for
version control on web
tools for collaboration and project organisation
:::

## Main tools

![](tools_quarto.png)

## Main tools

![](tools_Rstudio.png)

::: {.notes}
all of this will be done through Rstudio that will make everything easier
