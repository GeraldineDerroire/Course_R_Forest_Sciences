## Learning outcomes

::: {.incremental}
- Define the concept of reproducible research and cite the main tools that it requires
- Understand the basis of R and R studio (interface, packages, basic functions...)
- Import, manipulate and export data in R
- Apply good practices in data management
- Organise the work in a R studio project
:::


## Learning outcomes

::: {.incremental}
- Use the main packages of the Tidyverse for tidy analyses
- Choose the appropriate graphics to explore the data and create them using ggplot
- Implement basic statistical tests in R
- Understand and implement more advanced programming techniques (loops,
functions...)
- Use the tool Quarto to produce a report or a presentation with text and code
:::

# Let's make the class interactive... *não importa o idioma* 

::: {.notes}
presentation in English
i'll talk mostly in English, don't hesitate to ask me to repeat/rephrase
you can ask questions in portuguese

## Assessment

- **1/3 of the final mark** Short exercices given at the end of each class

- **2/3 of the final mark** A personnal project using the tools covered in class

## About the personal project

Objective: assessing your ability to implement a reproductible workflow in R
to explore and test your hypotheses. The relevance of the scientific question is **not** assessed.

- Using the tools covered during the class

- Doing some data exploration and basic analyses

## About the personal project

- You are encourage to work on your own data, but I can provide some if needed

- The project will be submitted as a pdf file and a GitHub repository
